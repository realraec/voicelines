# voicelines

Short applet that lets you play .OGG files from a wiki, while fetching the text associated with those
Uses an external library for HTML parsing
Allows you to search for a webpage directly
Handles links and words, recreates a URL in either case and checks if it the kind of URL that is expected, and if the server doesn't return an error

Creates a new button for each voiceline, and giving it its text
You can navigate through the list of buttons via the table of content to be found on the left-hand side
Clicking on an item on the left will reposition the scrollbar of the center area, effectively bringing you to the section you clicked on

Menu items that are lists that have all the gods/skins/AP to allow you to navigate your way through them all
Those lists do not load only once all the buttons are done loading, but update with each newly created button

Distinguishes between when an audio file is available (button enabled) and when it isn't (button disabled)
Useful when the text has been contributed, but not the audio file
